        <h2>NW Fuse</h2>
        <ol>
            <li class="py-1">
                Walk down the left staircase and 180 behind it to the beach.
            </li>
            <li class="py-1">
                Walk to the inner corner and aggro the frog with a wand shot. <span class="text-warning">This timing is very tight; if you are slow here, the frog may walk away.</span>
            </li>
            <li class="py-1">
                Run along the beach behind the cliff until you are about to be visible again. Target and grapple the large frog down to the beach and continue.
            </li>
            <li class="py-1">
                Run past the smaller frog, grapple up to the hook, run to and power the fuse.
            </li>
            <li class="py-1">
                As soon as the fuse is active, move to the inside pocket of the brick wall and target/orb down to the lower hook. Immediately re-target the hook to the lower-right and grapple to it.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>SW Fuse</h2>
        <ol>
            <li class="py-1">
                Run south toward the next fuse, hugging the lower side of the boardwalks and sand to avoid aggro-ing enemies.
            </li>
            <li class="py-1">
                When you reach the mountain, run up the ramps to the fuse and activate. Pause, quit, and continue as soon as the power line lights up.
            </li>
        </ol>
