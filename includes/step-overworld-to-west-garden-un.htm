                Run north out of Atoll and into Overworld. Run up the right side and <a href="#" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#ladderStorage">Ladder Storage</a> off of the top of the obscured ladder. Run up-left (see attached video for specific angle).

                While in Ladder Storage, intersect with the outer edge of the ground corner, shift slightly to the fox's right, and intersect with the broken tunnel's outer edge. This will <span class="text-warning">aggro the turret</span>. Keep running almost directly north, and aim for the small column with the telescope.
            </li>
            <li class="py-1">
                Let go of run just before the turret's shots intersect. This will <span class="text-warning">knock the fox out of Ladder Storage</span> and allow you to damage down with 1-2 shots. Run into West Garden.
