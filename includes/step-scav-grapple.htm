                Immediately re-freeze the Scav during thier "ice-break" animation and grapple repeatedly (usually 3x) until the Scav is off the left arena edge.

                If done quickly and correctly, the Scav will pop into the death plane. Obtain the <span class="badge bg-primary">Blue Key</span>, equip a bomb, and use it to death warp. Be sure to use the death animation to menu.
