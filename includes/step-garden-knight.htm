                Try to position yourself directly in line with boss and open with two full combos (1-2-3).

                The boss will backpedal. Roll forward and do a short combo (1-2). This should break poise and stagger the boss.
            </li>
            <li class="py-1">
                Repeat the first step (two full combos). If the boss backpedals, roll forward. Perform a short combo (1-2).
            </li>
            <li class="py-1">
                One or two more hits should finish the boss. Run towards the exit while the camera focuses on the boss. Open the chest for <span class="badge text-bg-warning">200 bits</span>. If you have <span class="text-info">more than 1 HP, switch to Orb</span>.
