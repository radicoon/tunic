                    <b>Ledge Clip</b>: To the right of the Atoll save is a broken stairway leading to a fallen ladder. If approached at the right angle, the fox can clip off of the ledge and fall down next to the ladder, skipping the slower route around the area.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is a small lip, hidden from the camera, behind the broken column near the save. If the fox runs directly at this and down the stairs, holding direction, it will walk over the edge and fall down to the sand.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note: This is only faster if you get it the first few times, but saves significant time if done on the first try. Beginners can skip this.

                Once you've successfully clipped off the edge, run along the water's edge, cross the fuse line, and divert right at the crabs and onto the brick walkway.

            <li class="py-1">
                Run to the back corner of Atoll, climb the ladder, and descend into Frog's Domain, cutting the corners the best you can. There are no real tricks to this section.
