        <h1>Boss: The Librarian (Ice Bomb)</h1>
        <hr>
        <p class="lead">
            "Basketbomb" the Librarian to a death plane.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li class="py-1">
                Climb the ladders to the librarian and stop at the top of the first.
            </li>
            <li class="py-1">
                Face south (down-right) and LS off the ladder up-left. Run left to the edge of the tower and cue a sword swipe. While swiping, hold up and throw the ice bomb.
            </li>
            <li class="py-1">
                If done correctly, the bomb will explode in mid-air after a precise bounce and aggro the Librarian. Sit tight and wait for the Librarian to collide with the death plane. <span class="text-danger">If he preps the seeking orb attack, you can move down the ladder enough to dodge it with good timing.</span>
            </li>
            <li class="py-1">
                Once the Librarian dies, climb back to the top of the tower and retrieve the Green Key. Throw a bomb to death warp back to Atoll.
            </li>
        </ol>
