            "Basketbomb" the Librarian to a death plane.

            The timing here is very tight and the directional movement is very precise&ndash;I advise using digital controls and practicing this quite a bit. You only get one shot!

                Climb the ladders to the librarian and stop at the top of the first.

            <li class="py-1">
                <span class="fw-bold text-info">At 120Hz:</span> Face south (down-right) and LS off the ladder up-left. Run left to the edge of the tower and cue a sword swipe. While swiping, hold up and throw the ice bomb.

            <li class="py-1">
                <span class="fw-bold text-info">At 60Hz:</span> Face south (down-right) and LS off the ladder up-left. Run left to the edge of the tower and cue a sword swipe while tapping up. While swiping, hold up and proc the ice bomb, and immediately swipe the sword again.

                If done correctly, the fox will snap back to the ladder and the bomb will explode in mid-air after a precise bounce and aggro the Librarian. Sit tight and wait for the Librarian to collide with the death plane. <span class="text-warning">If he preps the seeking orb attack, you can move up/down the ladder enough to dodge it with good timing.</span>

            <li class="py-1">
                Once the Librarian dies, climb back to the top of the tower and retrieve the Green Key. Throw a bomb to death warp back to Atoll.
