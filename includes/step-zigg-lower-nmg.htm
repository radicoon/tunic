                Run around the catwalks, keeping a tight line. Ignore the turrets and voidlings, they should not interact with you.

                You will eventually reach a platform with a chest and turret. <span class="text-warning">Immediately roll as you step onto the platform and keep running south.</span> This will bait the voidling to attack and (hopefully) jam them at the exit of the platform behind you.

                Run right and open the chest for <span class="text-info">mana berries (3)</span>. Reverse course and run west and down past the second save. Skip both save points (unless you are doing safer strats).
