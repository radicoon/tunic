                Make sure the <a href="#" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#speedrunner-code">speedrunner code</a> is active&mdash;this is best done just after the second fuse. This requires the <b>Orb, Dagger, Wand</b>.

                Walk to the edge of the broken fuse north of the shrine, target the nearest Scavenger and grapple him to you. They should begin to fall into the miasma.

                <span class="text-warning">Let them fall several frames</span> and then <a href="#" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#ice-grapple">ice grapple</a> them. You should immediately fall into the lower Quarry.

            <li class="py-1">
                As you are falling, <span class="text-warning">equip Effigy over Orb</span> and move your cursor to Sword. When you regain control, run to the Ziggurat in a tight line around the debris.

                Immediately pause, quit, and continue upon entering the Ziggurat. This will reset your HP bar to its pre-miasma state.
