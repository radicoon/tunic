                To summarize the above guide: throw your orb to hold it (it helps you spot your character in the dark). Navigate past the spikes in the hallways and descend down the uncovered ladder. <span class="text-info">This is a good time to <a href="#" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#magic-heal">magic heal</a>.</span>
            </li>
            <li class="py-1">
                Run west down the hall, down the stairwell and into the corner by the exit opening. <span class="text-info">I've found it easiest here to face exactly north (up-left), hold LT to lock your angle, and walk backwards into the spikes (as shown in the video).</span> If done right, you'll fall backwards through the spikes. You can immediately roll right and into the exit hallways.
            </li>
            <li class="py-1">
                Run around the tops of the turrets, and hug the lower wall through the next room. The next room can be tackled many ways: slowly with the stick, quickly with a roll and tough bomb throw, recklessly with a single bomb and blind roll. Practice this with the debug mod until you find a good way you feel comfortable tackling this room.

                Lift the lever to open the door. While it's opening, carefully navigate down to it. <span class="text-warning">If you want to save time, equip Glass Cannon.</span> Exit the furnace room and head into West Garden.
