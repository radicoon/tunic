                Equip the Effigy over the Sword while falling. Run south and open the chest to <span class="text-warning">get bombs (5)</span>. Quit and continue. Make sure the <a href="#" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#speedrunner-code">speedrunner code</a> is active.

                The goal is to re-enter the Lower Ziggurat scene and use the effigy <b>on the same frame</b>:
                <ul>
                    <li class="py-1">
                        If you are <span class="text-warning">too early</span>, you will start to throw the effigy. Pause, Quit to Menu, and try again.
                    </li>
                    <li class="py-1">
                        If you are <span class="text-warning">too late</span>, you will simply emerge into Lower Ziggurat as normal. Walk back north and try again.
                    </li>
                    <li class="py-1">
                        If you are <span class="text-info">successful</span>, the fox's feet will "snap" to be parallel and you will hear the faint beginning of the effigy animation when the screen turns black.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>          
            <li>
                On success, when you load in, fire one <a href="#" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#irc">ice beam</a> up-left and 3x more neutral (no direction). You should land on the lower catwalk that takes you to the Boss Scavenger.
