                Walk down the right staircase and LS off of the ladder. Run up to the NE fuse and, while holding run, cue a sword swipe and a wand shot.
            </li>
            <li class="py-1">
                The shot will bounce off the fuse and knock the fox out of LS. Immediately activate the fuse.

        <h2>SE Fuse (4)</h2>
        <ol>
            <li class="py-1">
                As soon as the fuse lights, orb down to the hook to the south and walk south along the brick catwalk.
                Target and <a href="#" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#ice-grapple">ice-grapple</a> the south-most small crab and head SW.

            <li class="py-1">
                Run to the white tree and grapple to the closest hook. Immediately grapple across the water to the next hook. Run past the crabs. <span class="text-info">The larger crab can be a good way to damage down to critical HP.</span>

            <li class="py-1">
                Run to the SE corner of Atoll, up a couple ladders, and activate the last fuse. Pause, quit, and continue as soon as the power line lights up.
