        <h1>Boss: The Librarian (Lure)</h1>
        <hr>
        <p class="lead">
            "Lure" the Librarian to a death plane.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li class="py-1">
                Climb the ladders to the librarian and stop at the top of the second.
            </li>
            <li class="py-1">
                Face the west (down-left) wall directly (use digital movement), hold target (LT), and walk backwards to the other wall. Throw the lure and immediately climb down the small ladder and about halfway down the larger ladder.
            </li>
            <li class="py-1">
                If done correctly, the lure will pivot north and aggro the Librarian once you are far below the death plane that appears when the boss fight begins. Sit tight and wait for the Librarian to collide with the death plane. <span class="text-danger">If he preps the seeking orb attack, you can move up the ladder enough to dodge it with good timing.</span>
            </li>
            <li class="py-1">
                Once the Librarian dies, climb back to the top of the tower and retrieve the Green Key. Throw a bomb to death warp back to Atoll.
            </li>
        </ol>
