                Approach Heir until the button prompt appears. Press Pause and scroll down to "Quit to Menu".

                If it actually quits to the main menu, congrats, it (probably) worked;
                if the cutscene plays as normal, sorry it didn't work this time.
                Be sure not to die in this cutscene and as soon as you get
                your UI back: pause, quit and continue.

            The timing between B and A is MUCH tighter at 120Hz than 60Hz. The same muscle memory will likely not work.
