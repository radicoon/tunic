                From below the corner, apply about 10% pressure to the analog stick and walk backwards (just barely right of straight up) toward the corner. <span class="text-warning">When the fox starts to vibrate, swing the sword</span> to move the fox back below the corner and repeat.

            Note: if the fox's shaking becomes SO even that it never seems to change, simply save and continue to reset and try again.
