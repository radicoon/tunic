                Run right at the fork and underneath the overhead walkway.

            <li class="py-1">
                Position the fox north-facing in front of the rubble pile, throw the ice bomb, and back up. If done correctly, the rudeling above will freeze. Immediately grapple to the rudeling.

                Open the chest to obtain bombs (4). Equip them immediately and let the fairy laser you. Once you are at minimum health, run toward the Ice Dagger cave. Use the previously-equipped Sword to slice the bushes blocking the way and enter the cave.
