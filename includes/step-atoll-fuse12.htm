                Walk down the left staircase and 180 behind it to the beach. Walk to the inner corner, target the frog and shoot it with wand. <span class="text-warning">This timing is tight; if you are slow here, the frog may walk away.</span>        
            </li>
            <li class="py-1">
                When the frog approaches, <a href="#" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#ice-grapple">ice-grapple</a> him and run to <span class="text-warning">activate the fuse</span>. The frog will thaw, approach and may attack but typically will not hit you (you can <a href="#" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#irc">ice-beam</a> him while praying if you wish to be safe).
            </li>
            <li class="py-1">
                As soon as the fuse is active, move to the inside pocket of the brick wall and grapple down to the lower hook. Immediately re-target the next hook and grapple to it.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>SW Fuse (2)</h2>
        <ol>
            <li class="py-1">
                Run south toward the next fuse, hugging the lower side of the area to avoid aggro-ing enemies.
            </li>
            <li class="py-1">
                When you reach the mountain, walk behind it to the NE edge and <a href="#" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#ice-grapple">ice-grapple</a> the small blue bird at the top.
            </li>
            <li class="py-1">
                Move away from the frozen bird and activate this fuse. Quit and continue as soon as the power line lights up.
