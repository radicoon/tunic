        <ul>
            <li>Make sure the <a href="#" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#speedrunner-code">speedrunner code</a> is active.</li>

            NOTE: The angle on this wand shot is very precise and as far as we know,
            there is no setup (as the camera is moving throughout). You'll just have to get a feel for it.

            RNG time! We now have to wait until the Scavenger is at the edge of the arena. There are two
            methods to quick-kill the Scavenger from here:
        </p>
            
        <div class="h3">Outcome 1: Downthrust Attack</div>
        <p>
            The Scavenger does their "jump-downthrust" attack at the edge of the arena:
            grapple them as they hit the ground.
        </p>
            
        <div class="h3">Outcome 2: Ice-Grapple</div>
        <p>
            If the Scavenger runs to the edge of the arena, you must immediately
            <a href="#" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#irc">ice-beam them</a>,
            wait for the ice to decay, and grapple them into the pit just before/as the ice is breaking.
        </p>
        <p>        
            Because the ice-decay explosion will knock you back, you must move a bit away from
            the ledge before grappling the boss. But if you walk back <b>too far</b>, you will
            grapple the Scavenger to your platform, and the run is basically over.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is <b>very tricky</b> to get into the proper position to execute the ice-grapple, and there are
            various ways to do so. You'll have to experiment to find what works for you. This is how some do it:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>While at the edge, tap "A" and "S" on keyboard (down+left) 3x with the lightest/quickest taps</li>
            <li>While at the edge, orb + down-left, orb+down, LT/target + orb</li>
        </ul>

        <hr>

        <p>
            If done correctly (regardless of method), Scav will fall into the pit and die.
            If you have any mana left, a quick wand shot or orb grapple could make them die faster.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Obtain the <span class="text-info fw-bold">Blue Key</span>, equip a bomb, and use it to death warp.</li>
            <li>Be sure to use the death animation to menu.</li>
        </ul>
