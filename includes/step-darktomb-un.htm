                Head right past the skull to the hidden ladder and <a href="#" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#ladderStorage">Ladder Storage</a> off the top.

                Circle around and run up the skull to gain a little height (to avoid activating the spikes in the hallway) and run into the tomb. Use the <a href="#" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#speedrunner-code">speedrunner code</a> if you need to get some visibility on the fox.
            </li>
            <li class="py-1">
                Run carefully to the right side of the chest and up the stairs. When you reach the back wall, circle back to the chest in a counter-clockwise motion and run against the chest.

                At this point, you can either:

                    <li class="py-1">
                        wait for an enemy hit you out of LS, or
                    </li>
                    <li class="py-1">
                        <span class="text-warning">swipe the sword and mash Action</span> to open the chest, which may or may not work. If you roll, try to hold Action to not lose LS and try again. Some players find using multiple Action keys or keyboard controls makes this more consistent.

                </ul>
