                Back to Atoll. Run north and again cross the gap with grapple. This time, run past the rudeling without damaging down. Again, head left and grapple up to the tuning fork.

                Run up and past the turret you previously used to effigy cancel into West Garden. Target and grapple the Envoy enemy to drop them into the water.
            </li>
            <li class="py-1">
                Run across the now-empty rail and grapple up to the tuning fork above the chest (you can reach it when you're about halfway across the rail). Head right/east and enter Dark Tomb.
