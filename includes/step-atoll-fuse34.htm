                Walk down the right staircase and run against the farthest right point.
                Target the group of crabs and fire a wand shot.
            </li>
            <li class="py-1">
                As soon as it strikes, re-target another crab and <a href="#" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#ice-grapple">ice-grapple</a> it.
            </li>
            <li class="py-1">
                Immediately and quickly run up and activate the fuse. <span class="text-warning">The crabs are unfortunately a bit RNG; consider freezing one to jam them up.</span>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>SE Fuse (4)</h2>
        <ol>
            <li class="py-1">
                As soon as the fuse lights, orb down to the hook to the south and walk south along the brick catwalk.
                Target and <a href="#" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#ice-grapple">ice-grapple</a> the south-most small crab and head SW.
            </li>
            <li class="py-1">
                Run to the white tree and grapple to the closest hook. Immediately grapple across the water to the next hook. Run past the crabs. <span class="text-info">The larger crab can be a good way to damage down to critical HP.</span>
            </li>
            <li class="py-1">
                Run to the SE corner of Atoll, up a couple ladders, and activate the last fuse. Pause, quit, and continue as soon as the power line lights up.
